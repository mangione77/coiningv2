coiningv2
=========

# Info

Coining was my final project for the Skylab Bootcamp. It's a Bitcoin news aggregator, where I got to play with __scraping__, __API's__, __NodeJS__, __MongoDB__ and more fun stuff.

I decided it wasn't really finished, so I'm working on the second version. Here you can find the frontend part, made in __React__.

## Motivation

'Cryptocurrencies' is a tricky keyword: people who are new to the subject might find quite difficult to understand what's going on, as information comes from so many different sources.

Coining aims at giving a solution to that problem: By bringing the information all together to one place, the user can access to the latest news, prices and tweets about bitcoin and crypto without having to rely on multiple apps or sources.

The backend part of this project is hosted in [this repo](https://github.com/mangione77/coiningv2-backend).
The scrapers are the same as the previous version and are hosted in [this repo](https://github.com/mangione77/coining-scraping)
